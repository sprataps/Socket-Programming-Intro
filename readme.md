Socket Programming in C (Projects done in Graduation)


Project 1:
Implementing TCP based server and client. Send a message to the server and server conducts and action on the message and relays back the appropriate solution.
Key points: Buffer size of server and client is different. Both the server and client wait for a random time before sending/receiving a message.  
  
     
Project 2:
Implement TCP and UDP server that interacts with a client. The server and the client exchange messages of a specific format. The client of a student interacts with the server of multiple other students. The total information retrieved from these interactions is stored in a file.
