Socket Programming in C (Projects done in Graduation)


Project 1:
Implementing TCP based server and client. Send a message to the server and server conducts and action on the message and relays back the appropriate solution.
Key points: Buffer size of server and client is different. Both the server and client wait for a random time before sending/receiving a message.
